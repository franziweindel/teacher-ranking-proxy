# Teacher-ranking proxy

**Goal:** compare existing proxies from the instruction / reasoning-distillation
literature that aim to predict which teacher produces the best SFT data for a
given student, from trajectories only, without running SFT.

**Relation to OpenThoughts-Agent.** This lives as `data/teacher_ranking_proxy/`
inside the `OpenThoughts-Agent` repo. Trajectory generation (Stage 2,
`generate_trajectories.py`, the `apptainer_patch/` shim, `bridge_deploy/`,
`harbor_patches.py`) imports Harbor and the repo's HPC stack, so it only runs
embedded there. The scoring and evaluation (Stages 3-4:
`compute_proxies.py`, `evaluate_ranking.py`, `judge.py`) are self-contained
(transformers/vLLM plus the pinned author repos under `upstream/`) and run on
existing trajectory files without the parent repo. The public standalone repo
is a snapshot/mirror of this folder.

## Proposed proxy for agentic tasks (SCRF)

Hypothesis: a useful teacher is one whose trajectories demonstrate
recovery behavior in the regions where the target student empirically
struggles.

Pipeline (same for student and teacher trajectories):

1. Extract (command, output) pairs from the trajectory.
2. Drop turns Harbor could not execute because the model's response was not valid Terminus-2 JSON (a parse error, no command ran); those are counted separately, not as command errors.
3. Classify each (command, output) with the Terminal-Bench 2.0 prompt and error taxonomy (11 categories, 91 subcategories) into one error category or "no error".
4. For the pairs classified as errors, a second LLM-as-judge call decides whether the model recovered, given the failed command and its output plus the next 3 commands and outputs (K=3).

This gives, per agent, a distribution over error categories and, within each, a
recovered / not-recovered split. A teacher is scored by how well its
recovered-error demonstrations cover the categories the student fails and does
not recover from.

Notation, per error category e: q_S(e) = fraction of the student's commands
that fail with e (student error density); E_T(e) = fraction of the teacher's
commands that fail with e (teacher error density); R_T(e) = fraction of the
teacher's e-errors judged recovered (a rate within category e; it ignores how
many e-errors there are). E_T(e)·R_T(e) = recovered e-errors / total commands =
how many recovery demonstrations per command the teacher actually provides for
e. 

Variations currently implemented (each at 11-category and 91-subcategory
granularity):

- **SCRF-all** = Σ_e q_S(e)·E_T(e)·R_T(e), with q_S(e) over all the student's failed commands. Weights every category the student errs in.
- **SCRF-unrecovered** = Σ_e q_S(e)·E_T(e)·R_T(e), with q_S(e) counting only the student's failed commands the K=3 judge marked NOT recovered. More targeted than SCRF-all: it weights only the categories the student cannot fix by itself, which is what the hypothesis is about.
- **SCRF-failed** = Σ_e q_S(e)·E_T(e)·R_T(e), with q_S(e) counting only commands from student trajectories that did not solve the task.
- **SCRF-KL** = -KL(P_S‖P_T), where P_S(e) = the student's not-recovered errors of category e / all its not-recovered errors, and P_T(e) = the teacher's recovered errors of category e / all its recovered errors (both normalized over categories, pooled at teacher level). Ranks teachers by how well their recovered-error distribution matches where the student gets stuck (`scrf_distribution_rank.py`, which also prints a plain overlap Σ_e P_S(e)·P_T(e) as a cross-check).



## Preliminary results

How we evaluate: score every teacher's trajectory for a fixed set of matched
Terminal-Lego tasks, aggregate per teacher, and compare the resulting teacher
ranking to the published SFT ranking for that student
(https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.03461). Two students: Qwen3-8B (headline,
all proxies) and Qwen3-32B (SCRF and the student-independent proxies, plus the
likelihood family at n=200). The paper's ground-truth rankings differ in one
useful way: for the 8B student GLM-5 and Qwen3.5-Plus are tied, for the 32B
student they are not.

    Qwen3-8B:  DeepSeek-V3.2 > {GLM-5 ≈ Qwen3.5-Plus} > Claude Opus 4.6
    Qwen3-32B: DeepSeek-V3.2 > GLM-5 > Qwen3.5-Plus > Claude Opus 4.6

1000 matched tasks (seed 42) is the headline; n=200 is kept below as the
smaller-sample snapshot. Full tables and metric definitions in
`docs/PROXY_RESULTS_n200.md`. tau-b is Kendall correlation with the GT order (+1
identical, -1 reversed); "top" is the predicted best teacher; P = bootstrap
probability the top teacher is correct.

GT (8B): DS > {GLM ≈ Q35} > CL.

tor, egs_post and egs_loop are reported in one predeclared view,
`list_strict_prevturn`: state-changing actions, the paper's alignment
examples, observation in any earlier response (chosen a priori, not by
agreement with the ground truth); all 24 views are in PROXY_SPEC 6.5.

### n=1000, Qwen3-8B student (headline)

At n=1000 the field separates into a clear top tier and the rest. All six SCRF
views, cmd_error (gpt-oss judge), and traj_length reach the maximum tau-b
(+0.91) with P(top-1) ~1.00; tor also reaches +0.91 but is less stable on top-1
(P~0.53). These proxies are indistinguishable on this benchmark: because GLM and
Q35 are tied in the ground truth, tau-b saturates at +0.91 and cannot separate a
proxy that predicts GLM > Q35 from one that predicts Q35 > GLM (that pair is a
tie, so it counts neither for nor against). So SCRF matches, but does not beat,
the cheaper cmd_error and traj_length baselines here; separating them needs
ground-truth rankings with more teachers or without the middle tie. All SCRF
numbers use the corrected per-command (JSON-anchored) segmentation and the
gpt-oss-120b judge.

| proxy | tau-b | top | P(top) | predicted order |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCRF-all, 11-cat | +0.91 | DS | 1.00 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| SCRF-all, 91-subcat | +0.91 | DS | 0.97 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| SCRF-unrecovered, 11-cat | +0.91 | DS | 1.00 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| SCRF-unrecovered, 91-subcat | +0.91 | DS | 0.96 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| SCRF-failed, 11-cat | +0.91 | DS | 0.99 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| SCRF-failed, 91-subcat | +0.91 | DS | 0.90 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| cmd_error more (gpt-oss) | +0.91 | DS | 1.00 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL |
| tor | +0.91 | DS | 0.99 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL |
| egs_loop | +0.91 | DS | 0.76 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL |
| traj_length (more, tokens/turns) | +0.91 | DS | 1.00 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL |
| grace | +0.18 | Q35 | 0.03 | Q35 > GLM > DS > CL |
| aslec_drop, scas, egs_post | +0.18 | Q35 | 0.00 | Q35 > GLM > DS > CL |
| global_nll (GRAPE), local_nll k1-8, aslec_casl | -0.18 | Q35 | 0.00 | Q35 > GLM > CL > DS |
| rsr | -0.18 | CL | 0.00 | CL > DS > GLM > Q35 |
| teacher_bench, error_retry, cmd_error (fewer) | -0.91 | CL | 0.00 | CL > ... > DS |

### Qwen3-32B student: the tie-free ground truth separates SCRF from length

The 32B ground truth has no tie, so tau-b can reach +1.0 and the proxies that
tied at +0.91 above can be told apart. q_S(32B) is built from n=200 Qwen3-32B
student traces (`runs/terminal_lego-n200-s42-q32b`); teacher-side scoring uses
the same 1000 tasks and gpt-oss-120b judge as the 8B run.

| proxy | tau-b | top | P(top) | predicted order | GLM > Q35 middle right? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCRF (all six views) | +1.00 | DS | 0.97-0.99 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL | yes |
| cmd_error more (gpt-oss) | +1.00 | DS | 1.00 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL | yes |
| traj_length (more, tokens/turns) | +0.67 | DS | 1.00 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL | no |
| tor | +0.67 | DS | 0.99 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL | no |
| teacher_bench | -0.67 | CL | 0.00 | CL > GLM > Q35 > DS | - |
| error_retry (raw upstream score) | -1.00 | CL | 0.00 | CL > Q35 > GLM > DS | - |
| error_retry (turn-aware views) | -0.67 | CL | 0.00 | CL > GLM > Q35 > DS | - |

SCRF and cmd_error recover the full 32B ranking; traj_length and tor get the
top and bottom teacher right but swap the middle pair, which is exactly the
pair the 8B tie hid. Caveat on tor: the paper's own TOR values (Table 3:
DeepSeek 13.4%, GLM 7.3%, Qwen3.5-Plus 6.5%, Claude 2.5%) do order the four
teachers exactly like the 32B ground truth, while our original
operationalization gives 56 / 49 / 55 / 33 with GLM and Qwen3.5-Plus swapped.
The paper gives the observation list and three alignment examples but no
action list, and its code is unreleased, so `compute_proxies.py` reports TOR
in 24 predeclared views, `<actions>_<align>_<window>` (PROXY_SPEC 6.5 has
the definitions and the full table): actions {list = edit/install/run
commands, all = every non-observation command}, align {loose = original,
strict = the paper's examples, exact = same path}, window {prevturn = any
earlier response, turn1/2/3 = the last k responses}. Observations in the same
response as the action never count (Terminus-2 types a response's commands
as one batch and only then returns the screen), which is what inflated the
original score to 56 / 49 / 55 / 33. Per-teacher means (n=1000, %):

| view | DS | GLM | Q35 | CL | order | tau-b 8B / 32B |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| paper Table 3 | 13.4 | 7.3 | 6.5 | 2.5 | DS > GLM > Q35 > CL | +0.91 / +1.00 |
| list_strict_prevturn | 32.8 | 20.8 | 30.0 | 6.7 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL | +0.91 / +0.67 |
| list_exact_prevturn | 28.4 | 16.4 | 25.7 | 4.9 | DS > Q35 > GLM > CL | +0.91 / +0.67 |
| list_exact_turn1 | 18.9 | 11.7 | 19.3 | 3.2 | Q35 > DS > GLM > CL | +0.55 / +0.33 |
| all_strict_prevturn | 27.4 | 22.4 | 30.3 | 6.4 | Q35 > DS > GLM > CL | +0.55 / +0.33 |

Claude lands at the paper's level once same-response observations are
excluded; tightening align() changes little; widening the action set or
shortening the window to one turn puts Qwen3.5-Plus first. No view
reproduces GLM > Qwen3.5-Plus and the other three teachers stay 2-3x above
the paper, so something in the paper's unreleased action definition or path parsing is
still different; tor's +0.67 on the 32B ground truth is therefore a property
of our operationalizations, not established for the paper's metric. So on the one benchmark that can separate them, the
recovery-aware proxies beat pure length. SCRF does not beat cmd_error here (both
are perfect); separating those two needs a teacher that errs a lot but does not
recover.

Likelihood proxies under the 32B student (n=200, `docs/PROXY_RESULTS_n200.md`
style run on `runs/terminal_lego-n200-s42/proxy_scores/Qwen__Qwen3-32B`):
GRAPE, LALP k1-8, ASLEC-CASL and ASLEC-DROP all -0.33 (Q35 > GLM > CL > DS),
SCAS 0.00 (Q35 > GLM > DS > CL), RSR 0.00 (CL > DS > GLM > Q35). GRAPE and LALP k1-k4 at n=1000 give the same -0.33. The same-family bias (Qwen3.5-Plus first) persists
with the larger Qwen student. GRACE for 32B is not computed (TRAK fp32
gradients at 32B risk OOM on one GPU).

## Additional findings

- traj_length reproduces the 8B ranking (tau-b +0.91) but that is pure length: DeepSeek writes the longest trajectories. Its GLM/Q35 order differs from SCRF's; for the 8B student that pair is a ground-truth tie, so no verdict, but for the 32B student the pair is ordered (GLM > Q35) and traj_length gets it wrong (+0.67) while SCRF and cmd_error get it right (+1.00). TOR (+0.91) and cmd_error are rates (per action, per command), so they are not mechanically length-driven; TOR reflects DeepSeek inspecting before acting more. cmd_error per command was ambiguous at n=200 (gpt-oss judge said GLM, qwen said DS) but resolves to a clean DS > GLM > Q35 > CL at n=1000 (tau-b +0.91, P=1.00) with the gpt-oss judge; the per-turn "DeepSeek first" seen earlier was a batching artifact.
- Every student-likelihood proxy except RSR (GRAPE, LALP at all k, ASLEC, SCAS, GRACE) ranks Qwen3.5-Plus first for the Qwen3-8B student (same-family bias); the ones rerun under the Qwen3-32B student (GRAPE, LALP, ASLEC at n=200) do the same. RSR, which the paper reads as lower = better, is the mirror image: Claude first, Qwen3.5-Plus last, for both students. (Until 2026-09-10 RSR was reported with the sign reversed, i.e. as Q35 > GLM > DS > CL.)
- **SCRF works and stabilizes with n.** With the corrected per-command segmentation and the gpt-oss-120b judge, all SCRF variations reproduce the published ranking (tau-b +0.91, DeepSeek top-1) at both taxonomy granularities. At n=200 it is right but not yet bootstrap-stable (P(top-1) ~0.68 at 11-cat, ~0.50 at 91-subcat); at n=1000 every SCRF view is highly stable (P(top-1) 0.90-1.00, 11-cat > 91-subcat). For the 8B student it ties cmd_error and traj_length at the tau-b ceiling (+0.91): the GLM/Q35 ground-truth tie caps tau-b, so no proxy can be shown to separate there. The 32B ground truth has no tie and does separate them: SCRF +1.00 (all views), traj_length +0.67 (section above). q_S sensitivity to the number of student traces is still open: the 8B run with q_S from 1000 instead of 200 student traces hit the score cache and was not actually recomputed (job 4140407; the file is byte-identical to the 200-trace one), so it has to be rerun with the cache cleared.
- **But it is judge-dependent.** With the Qwen3-32B judge the same proxy is weak at n=200 (tau-b -0.18..+0.55, GLM first). So the signal is real but hinges on judge quality at the error-labelling step. (An earlier version, before the segmentation fix, made SCRF look signal-less; that was a parsing artifact.)

  | SCRF-unrecovered | judge | segmentation | tau-b | top-1 | P(top-1) |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 11-category | gpt-oss-120b | JSON-anchored (current) | +0.91 | DS ✓ | 0.68 |
  | 91-subcategory | gpt-oss-120b | JSON-anchored (current) | +0.91 | DS ✓ | 0.50 |
  | 11-category | Qwen3-32B | JSON-anchored (current) | +0.18 | GLM ✗ | 0.33 |
  | (any) | gpt-oss-120b | per-turn (old, batching artifact) | +0.55 | DS | 0.24 |
  | (any) | Qwen3-32B | per-turn (old) | +0.18 | Q35 ✗ | 0.07 |
- **n matters: unstable at 200, stable at 1000.** At n=200, under task-bootstrap resampling most proxies' own teacher ranking is not reproduced in 80% of resamples, i.e. a different sample of tasks would likely give a different ranking (per-trajectory score variance within a teacher is as large as or larger than the variance between teacher means, so teacher identity is a coarse selection unit). Extending to n=1000 resolves this for the proxies that carry signal: SCRF (all views) and cmd_error reach P(top-1) 0.90-1.00, and cmd_error with the gpt-oss judge jumps from tau-b +0.55 (n=200) to +0.91, P=1.00 (n=1000). The proxies that were wrong at n=200 (the student-likelihood family) stay wrong at n=1000, so more tasks sharpen the verdict rather than rescuing weak proxies.
- **Judge agreement is high on failure detection but low on the fine taxonomy** (two judges, Qwen3-32B vs gpt-oss-120b, identical commands):

  | judgment | n | agreement |
  |---|---|---|
  | is it a failure? | 12,244 commands | 98.5% |
  | recovered? (K=3) | 838 failures | 85.9% |
  | which of the 11 categories | 1,381 failures | 61.0% |
  | which of the 91 subcategories | 1,381 failures | 51.6% |

  so error/recovery signals are judge-robust, but the fine subcategory label is not, which is why SCRF is also reported at the 11-category level.

## Layout

Stage 1-2 (data):
- `prepare_dataset.py`: builds the matched task list and pins the teacher trajectory files.
- `generate_trajectories.py`: runs the student on the sampled tasks to produce its traces.

Stage 3 (score each teacher trajectory):
- `compute_proxies.py`: per (teacher, task) score for every proxy.
- `judge.py`: the LLM judge used by cmd_error and SCRF.

Stage 4 (rank and analyze):
- `evaluate_ranking.py`: teacher rankings, bootstrap, sample-efficiency.

Supporting scripts:
- `plot_scrf_errors.py`: error-category distributions behind SCRF.
- `scrf_distribution_rank.py`: SCRF-KL / overlap teacher ranking, derived (no rerun) from the per-task scrf components; separate from compute_proxies because it is a teacher-level score over pooled distributions, not a per-(teacher, task) score (like GRACE's teacher-level step).

- `slurm/`: cluster launch scripts. `docs/`: specs and the results write-up.
- `runs/`, `venv/`, `upstream/` (the cloned author repos) are under `$WS_ROOT/teacher_ranking_proxy/`.

## To dos

- TOR still 2-3x the paper's Table 3 values and GLM/Qwen3.5-Plus swapped in every one of the 24 views (see the 32B section). Remaining candidates: per-turn instead of per-command counting, a narrower "state-changing" action definition (file edits only), or stricter path parsing (only explicit file operands). Ask the authors for the TOR script; teacher-only, seconds to rerun. The old single-score file is kept as `proxy_scores/*/tor__v1_listloose.jsonl`.
- Rerun 8B SCRF with q_S built from the 1000-trace student run (clear `proxy_scores/Qwen__Qwen3-8B/scrf@gpt-oss-120b.jsonl` first; the 200-trace result is kept as `scrf@gpt-oss-120b__qS200.jsonl`) to check how many student traces q_S needs.
- Finish the 32B likelihood family: fix the device mismatch in `_trajectory_scas_components` (index tensor must live on the model's device when the 32B student is sharded over 2 GPUs) and rerun SCAS and GRACE; the n=1000 run of local_nll_k8, aslec, rsr, scas for 32B was in flight when the Capella storage outage of 2026-09-09 hit.
- Third judge (GLM-4.6-FP8) for 3-way agreement on cmd_error/SCRF labels: needs two nodes (337 GB weights); the alpha 8x40 GB attempt OOMs and the Capella 2-node Ray/vLLM bringup did not become healthy within 40 min.
- Build a pipeline that finds more ground-truth student/teacher rankings on agentic tasks, from open-source trajectories and tasks, so proxies can be validated on more than the one Terminal-Lego ranking. Started in `litmine/` (literature-mining pipeline; spec in `docs/PIPELINE.md`).
- Look for ground-truth rankings that are FLOPs/token-budget controlled, i.e. teachers compared at equal SFT compute, so a teacher does not count as better only because its trajectories are longer (more training tokens). The length finding above makes this important.
